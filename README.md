# pg_query_go [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lfittl/pg_query_go.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/lfittl/pg_query_go) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/lfittl/pg_query_go?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/lfittl/pg_query_go)

Go version of https://github.com/lfittl/pg_query

This Go library and its cgo extension use the actual PostgreSQL server source to parse SQL queries and return the internal PostgreSQL parse tree.

Note that the original Ruby version of this library is much more feature complete.

You can find further background to why a query's parse tree is useful here: https://pganalyze.com/blog/parse-postgresql-queries-in-ruby.html


## Installation

```
go get github.com/lfittl/pg_query_go
```

Due to compiling parts of PostgreSQL, the first time you build against this library it will take a bit longer.

Expect up to 3 minutes. You can use `go build -x` to see the progress.


## Usage

### Parsing a query into JSON

Put the following in a new Go package, after having installed pg_query as above:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "github.com/lfittl/pg_query_go"
)

func main() {
  tree, err := pg_query.ParseToJSON("SELECT 1")
  if err != nil {
    panic(err);
  }
  fmt.Printf("%s\n", tree)
}
```

Running will output the query's parse tree as JSON:

```json
$ go run main.go
[{"SELECT": {"distinctClause": null, "intoClause": null, "targetList": [{"RESTARGET": {"name": null, "indirection": null, "val": {"A_CONST": {"val": 1, "location": 7}}, "location": 7}}], "fromClause": null, "whereClause": null, "groupClause": null, "havingClause": null, "windowClause": null, "valuesLists": null, "sortClause": null, "limitOffset": null, "limitCount": null, "lockingClause": null, "withClause": null, "op": 0, "all": false, "larg": null, "rarg": null}}]
```

### Parsing a query into Go structs

When working with the query information inside Go its recommended you use the `Parse()` method which returns Go structs:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "reflect"
  "github.com/lfittl/pg_query_go"
  nodes "github.com/lfittl/pg_query_go/nodes"
)

func main() {
  tree, err := pg_query.Parse("SELECT 1")
  if err != nil {
    panic(err);
  }

  fmt.Printf("%s\n", reflect.DeepEqual(tree, pg_query.ParsetreeList{
    Statements: []nodes.Node{
      nodes.SelectStmt{
        TargetList: []nodes.Node{
          nodes.ResTarget{
            Val: nodes.A_Const{
              Type: "integer",
              Val: nodes.Value{
                Type: nodes.T_Integer,
                Ival: 1,
              },
              Location: 7,
            },
            Location: 7,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  }));
}
```

You can find all the node struct types in the `nodes/` directory.
